This module will have set of default tests for JSON files that we have or that we will generate in future.

Main task is here: https://github.com/GroceriStar/sd/issues/471

We have a few files, stored at https://github.com/ChickenKyiv/awesome-food-db-strucutures/tree/master/USDA-01-06-2019


- [ ] add tests

- [ ] update structure for data and raw folders
- [ ] update readme file
- [ ] shelljs or shx?
